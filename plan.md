# PhysioRoutine - Future Plans & Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, enhancements, and long-term vision for the PhysioRoutine project. The roadmap is divided into short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals to provide a clear path for development.

## Short-Term Goals (Next 1-3 Months)

*Focus: Transitioning from a client-only prototype to a full-fledged web application with core features enhanced for better usability.*

### 1. Backend Integration & User Accounts

-   **Objective:** Move beyond `localStorage` to enable user data persistence and multi-device access.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **Phase 1 (Backend Selection):** Choose and set up a backend service. Options:
        -   **BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service):** Firebase or Supabase for rapid development, handling authentication, and database needs.
        -   **Custom Backend:** Develop a simple Node.js/Express API with a MongoDB or PostgreSQL database for more control.
    -   **Phase 2 (User Authentication):** Implement a complete user registration and login system (email/password, social logins).
    -   **Phase 3 (Data Migration):** Refactor the `db.js` module to interact with the new backend API. All routines and progress data will be tied to a user account.

### 2. UI/UX Enhancements

-   **Objective:** Improve the user experience by adding highly requested features.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **Search Functionality:** Add a search bar to the Exercise Library to allow users to find exercises by name.
    -   **Routine Editing:** Implement the ability for users to edit their saved routines. This includes reordering, adding, or removing exercises.
    -   **Improved Exercise Player:** Enhance the player with:
        -   Rest timers between sets and exercises.
        -   Audio cues (e.g., beeps) to signal the start/end of an exercise.

### 3. Code Quality & Tooling

-   **Objective:** Establish a modern development workflow to ensure code quality and scalability.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **Introduce a Build Tool:** Integrate a tool like Vite or Parcel to handle module bundling, minification, and provide a better development server experience.
    -   **Add Linting & Formatting:** Set up ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent code style and catch common errors.
    -   **Unit Testing:** Begin writing unit tests for critical logic, starting with the database and authentication modules.

## Mid-Term Goals (3-6 Months)

*Focus: Expanding the application's feature set to increase user engagement and provide more value.*

### 1. Advanced Progress Analytics

-   **Objective:** Give users deeper insights into their physiotherapy journey.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **Visual Dashboards:** Introduce charts and graphs (using a library like Chart.js) to visualize trends in activity, duration, and consistency over time.
    -   **Session Notes:** Allow users to add notes or rate their pain/comfort level after completing a routine.

### 2. Content & Community Features

-   **Objective:** Grow the application from a utility into a resource hub.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **Pre-built Routines:** Add a collection of expertly curated routines for common goals (e.g., "Morning Stretch," "Lower Back Pain Relief").
    -   **Video Demonstrations:** Augment or replace GIFs with high-quality video demonstrations for exercises.
    -   **Routine Sharing:** Allow users to share their custom routines with others via a unique link.

### 3. Notifications

-   **Objective:** Help users stay consistent with their routines.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **Web Push Notifications:** Implement reminders to prompt users to complete their scheduled routines.

## Long-Term Vision (6+ Months)

*Focus: Evolving the project into a polished, professional-grade platform with potential for commercialization.*

### 1. AI & Personalization

-   **Objective:** Provide intelligent, personalized recommendations.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Develop a recommendation engine that suggests new exercises or routines based on a user's progress, goals, and feedback.

### 2. Therapist & Patient Portal

-   **Objective:** Bridge the gap between physiotherapists and their patients.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **Therapist Dashboard:** Create a separate portal for verified physiotherapists to manage their patients, create custom routines, and assign them to specific users.
    -   **Patient-Therapist Communication:** Add a secure messaging feature for patients to communicate with their assigned therapist.

### 3. Platform Expansion

-   **Objective:** Make the application available on more platforms.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **Mobile Applications:** Develop native or cross-platform (e.g., React Native, Flutter) mobile apps for iOS and Android to provide a superior mobile experience.
    -   **Wearable Integration:** Allow users to sync their activity data from wearables like Apple Watch or Fitbit.

### 4. Monetization

-   **Objective:** Explore avenues for making the project financially sustainable.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   **Premium Features:** Introduce a subscription model (e.g., "PhysioRoutine Pro") that unlocks advanced features like the therapist portal, in-depth analytics, or personalized AI plans.
    -   **Content Marketplace:** Create a marketplace where certified therapists can sell their specialized routine plans.
